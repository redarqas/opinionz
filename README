### Twitter opinion tracker

The aim of the application is to extract in real time opinion from twitter public stream. 
The application processes each tweet by giving it an opinion evalution from an external serivce called Viralheat. 
And finally serves the result to the client.

### Technos

Twitter public stream is manipulated trough iteratee api from play framework. And it uses some Akka actors to separate responsablities : streaming, 
finding opinion, and word tracking.

TODO : For now the applcation stores tweets in mongodb database using ReactiveMongo, this will allow the application to give statistics to users.
